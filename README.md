# my-ecommerce-backend

## Description

The purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of the fundamental architecture of e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce backend is a REST API for an internet retail website. The API is built onto an Express.js server that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This e-commerce backend has the API routes that point to each of the standard CRUD operations for each data group. The routes can be used to: 
- Create categories, products and tags
- View categories, products and tags
- Establish connections between the different routes
- Update categories, products and tags
- Delete entries from the database
